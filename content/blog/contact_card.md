I got my Contact Cards printed
::

::BlogContentParagraph
After a few events where I had to share my contacts with people, it became obvious that I needed a Contact Card
::

So Here's how it looks

Front
::
<img width="400px" height="400px" alt="Pixel Art" src="/png/contact_card_front.png"></img>
::BlogContentParagraph
I chose Pixel Art as it represents me everywhere and it looks cute
::
::BlogContentParagraph
Back
::
<img width="400px" height="400px" alt="Pixel Art" src="/png/contact_card_back.png"></img>
::div
::BlogContentParagraph
This is just my contact information i wanted to go with something minimalistic

What's coming next?

Well besides sharing my Contact Card, I have been working on some projects, A new Project will soon make its debut. Here's a hint it's something related to Calories and Nutrition. To get an invite for the project launch and all upcoming updates you should subscribe to my newsletters, maybe you will get to be a beta tester for a few of my projects <Icon name="fluent-emoji-flat:crossed-fingers" class="size-14"/>
